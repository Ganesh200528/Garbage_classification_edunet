# Waste Classification using AI – GreenSkill Internship

## 📅 Week 1: Project Initiation & Dataset Preparation

### 🎯 Goals

- Understand the project scope and objectives under the **GreenSkill Internship**.
- Explore existing methods for **waste classification using AI**.
- Identify dataset requirements and gather sample images for:
  - Organic waste
  - Recyclable waste
  - E-waste
  - Hazardous waste

---

### ✅ Work Done

- Conducted research on **CNN-based image classification** approaches specific to garbage identification.
- Collected and cleaned a dataset divided into 4 categories:
  - Organic
  - Recyclable
  - E-waste
  - Hazardous
- Organized the dataset into separate folders for each class.
- Uploaded a **sample dataset** to this GitHub repository for initial testing and version control.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- **Imbalanced dataset**: Recyclable waste had significantly more images than other categories.
- Needed to **rename and preprocess** all image files to ensure consistency and avoid issues during model training.

---

### 🛠️ Improvisations

- Used **OpenCV** and **Pillow** libraries to:
  - Resize and normalize image dimensions.
  - Remove noisy backgrounds using **contour masking** techniques.
- Created a structured folder layout to enable:
  - Streamlined model training.
  - Easy updates and additions to the dataset.
